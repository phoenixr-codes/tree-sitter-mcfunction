The structure of commands is mostly generated by parsing markdown files from
the Microsoft Minecraft API documentation. This happens in `fetch-commands.cjs`.
Note that the structure of the command documentation might change in the future
which causes the script to break.

Additionally, the `emojis.json` and `aliases.json` in the `data` directory can
be configured when Minecraft updates these accordingly.
